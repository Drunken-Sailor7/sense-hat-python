# sense-hat-python
A collection of little python scripts written for the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT

## Prerequisites
- a Raspberry Pi
- a Sense HAT add-on
- python3 installed

## Usage
To run a select script on your own Raspberry Pi, open the terminal and navigate to desired folder. Then download the script and run it, replacing 'example.py' with your script name of choice.

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drunken-Sailor7/sense-hat-python/master/example.py
$ python3 example.py
```

Alternitavely, should you want to use multiple scripts, it may be easier to clone the entire repository and select scripts locally.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Drunken-Sailor7/sense-hat-python.git
$ cd sense-hat-python
$ python3 example.py
```
